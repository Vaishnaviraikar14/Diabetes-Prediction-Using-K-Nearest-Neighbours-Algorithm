# Diabetes-Prediction-Using-K-Nearest-Neighbours-Algorithm
About Dataset :-
It is the most common dataset that is used by ML learners to understand how the K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm works by using it on real-world problems and their dataset. This dataset contains the diagnostic measurements collected by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases of the patients who were diagnosed with Diabetes and the ones who werenâ€™t. This dataset is considered as a good resource to help us understand the working of Machine Learning algorithms in real world problems.
The dataset comprises of 9 columns (features) with labels like Glucose, Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness, etc.

All the features in the dataset are:

Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant

Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test

BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)

SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)

Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)

BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)2)

DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function

Age: Age (years)

Outcome: Class variable (Binary result: 0 or 1)
